# Commercial license

Klerk is open sourced under [AGPL](https://github.com/klerk-framework/klerk/blob/main/LICENSE.md). 

If you need a commercial licence, contact us at info@klerkframework.dev.

As long as Klerk in beta, the commercial license is free. However, you should expect to find bugs in the beta state. Since it is important for us that your project succeeds, 
we currently only provide commercial licenses when you sign a support agreement with us so that we can help you if there is any problem.

When Klerk leaves the beta state, we will no longer provide commercial licenses for free (but licenses acquired during beta will 
still be valid without any cost).
