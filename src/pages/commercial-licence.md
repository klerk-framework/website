# Commercial license

Clerk is open sourced under [AGPL](https://gitlab.com/linustornkrantz/dataframework/-/blob/master/LICENSE.md?ref_type=heads). 

If you need a commercial licence, contact us at ...

As long as Clerk in alpha, a commercial license is free. However, you should expect to find bugs in the alpha state and since it is important for us that your project succeeds, 
we currently only provide commercial licenses when you sign a support agreement with us.

When Clerk leaves the alpha state, the commercial license will no longer be free (but licenses acquired during alpha will 
still be valid without any cost).
