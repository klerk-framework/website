# Plugins

Klerk can be extended with plugins. A plugin can modify the configuration, enhance the DSL and provide UI.

The following plugins are available:

* [__Web Tools__](/docs/plugins/html) - Autogenerated web UI suitable for an administrator of the system. Also includes
an automatic HTML form builder for your events. 
* [__GraphQL__](/docs/plugins/graphql) - Autogenerated GraphQL API. 
* __Basic Email Service__ - Provides basic transactional email sending functionality. 
* __Postmark Email Service__ - Like _Basic Email Service_ but provides a deeper integration with [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/).
