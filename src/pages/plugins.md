# Plugins

Klerk can be extended with plugins. A plugin can modify the configuration, enhance the DSL and provide UI.

The following plugins are available:

* [__Web__](/docs/plugins/web) - The plugin can generate an admin UI which allows you to browse the data, issue commands,
  view documentation (state diagrams, event parameters etc.), audit logs and more. It also includes an HTML form builder for your events. 
* [__GraphQL__](/docs/plugins/graphql) - Autogenerated GraphQL API. 
* __Basic Email Service__ - Provides basic transactional email sending functionality. 
* __Postmark Email Service__ - Like _Basic Email Service_ but provides a deeper integration with [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/).
