# Java interoperability

You will primarily use Kotlin when developing your application. Since both Kotlin and Java runs
on the JVM, it is possible to mix the languages. This allows you to benefit from the rich Java ecosystem. 

While it is theoretically possible to use Java when
declaring rules and interacting with Clerk, this is not recommended. However, it may make sense
to mix Kotlin and Java in your own code if you have a legacy application in Java which doesn't have to interact directly with 
Clerk, at least not much.
