# Java interoperability

You will primarily use Kotlin when developing your application. But since both Kotlin and Java runs
on the JVM, it is possible to mix the languages. While it is theoretically possible to use Java when
declaring rules and interacting with Clerk, it is not recommended. However, it may make sense
to mix Kotlin and Java if you have a legacy application in Java which doesn't have to interact directly with 
Clerk, at least not much.
